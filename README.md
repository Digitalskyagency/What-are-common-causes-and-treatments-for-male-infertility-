# What-are-common-causes-and-treatments-for-male-infertility-

Male infertility can stem from low sperm count, poor motility, abnormal morphology, blockage of the reproductive tract, hormonal disorders, genetic issues, infections, varicocele, lifestyle factors (smoking, heat, toxins), or idiopathic causes. Initial evaluation includes semen analysis (often repeated), hormonal profile, scrotal ultrasound and history. Treatments range from lifestyle changes and medical therapy (for hormonal or infection causes) to surgical correction (e.g., varicocele or obstruction) and assisted reproductive techniques: IUI for mild issues, ICSI with IVF for severe sperm abnormalities or surgically retrieved sperm. Genetic counseling is needed for certain severe abnormalities. Many causes are treatable â€” early assessment of both partners speeds up appropriate management.
